# Mudak

Mudak is a console equivalent of the Russian card game Durak. It contains 2 projects:

<b>MudakCore</b>: the main methods and implementations required for the game to work. The game currently only supports 2-player mode.

<b>MudakConsole</b>: the console interface for the game, along with a couple AIs.
You are welcome to try and code a new AI that would beat the existing ones! All AIs implement the interface IAI.
